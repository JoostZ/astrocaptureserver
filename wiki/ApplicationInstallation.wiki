Installation of !AstroCaptureServer application 

The !AstroCaptureServer does not require an installation. You just download the zip file and unzip it to a folder you want. Then you run !AscomGuiding.

However, you do need the ASCOM platform setup. If you don't have it, go to http://ascom-standards.org/Downloads/Index.htm and install the ASCOM Platform from that page. You also need to install the ASCOM .NET Client Toolkit Update from http://ascom-standards.org/Downloads/PlatformUpdates.htm.

Then you need to download the ASCOM driver for your Hardware.
